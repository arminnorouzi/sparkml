## Introduction
The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to set up `Pyspark` in Google Colab and perform predictive modelling on a real-world dataset, "[Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023)". The tutorial will familiarize you with the `SparkML` framework and show you how to utilize its extensive features for your data science projects.

## Installation
The installation section provides a step-by-step guide on setting up Pyspark in Google Colab. It will take you through the necessary steps and commands required to install and run `Pyspark` in a Colab notebook.

## Dataset
In this tutorial, we'll work with the "[Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023)" Kaggle dataset. This section provides an overview of the dataset, its features, and how to load it in Pyspark.

## Data Preprocessing
Here, we dive into essential data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, data transformation, and feature engineering to prepare our dataset for machine learning modeling.

## Model Building
This section will guide you through the process of building machine learning models using `SparkML`. We'll cover various models and demonstrate how to train and test them on our preprocessed dataset.

## Model Evaluation and Tuning
Finally, we evaluate the performance of our models using various metrics and also demonstrate how to tune the hyperparameters of our models for optimal performance.

## Conclusion
At the end of this tutorial, you'll gain a thorough understanding of using SparkML in Google Colab, handling real-world datasets, and applying machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.
